# Discord Points Bot README

## Overview
This is a Discord bot designed to manage a points-based economy system using "Diamonds" (üíé) as currency. Users can earn, spend, transfer, and gamble points, redeem gift cards, and view leaderboards. The bot is built using Node.js and the `discord.js` library, with data persistence via a JSON file.

## Bot Structure
The bot is structured as a modular Node.js application with the following components:

### Core Components
- **Client Setup**: Uses `discord.js` with intents for Guilds, GuildMessages, and MessageContent to interact with Discord servers, channels, and messages.
- **PointsBot Class**: Manages user data, settings, and gift card requests, with methods for data persistence (`saveData`, `loadData`) and streak calculations.
- **Data Storage**: Stores user data (points, streaks, etc.) and settings in a `bot_data.json` file, with auto-saving every 5 minutes.
- **Channel Configuration**: Uses specific channel IDs for different functionalities (e.g., daily claims, gambling, leaderboard) defined in the `CHANNELS` object.
- **Gift Card System**: Supports predefined gift cards (e.g., PCRP Gift Card) with costs and emojis, stored in the `GIFT_CARDS` object.

### Key Files
- **index.js**: Main bot script containing all logic, event handlers, and command implementations.
- **bot_data.json**: Persistent storage for user points, streaks, and gift card requests.

### Dependencies
- `discord.js`: For Discord API interactions.
- `fs` (Node.js File System): For reading/writing to `bot_data.json`.
- `path`: For handling file paths.

## Plan
The bot is designed to provide an engaging economy system for Discord communities with the following goals:
- **User Engagement**: Encourage daily interaction through daily claims with streak bonuses.
- **Economy Management**: Allow users to earn, transfer, and spend points on gambling or gift cards.
- **Gambling Features**: Offer fun games (Dice, Coinflip, Slots) with varying risk/reward mechanics.
- **Reward System**: Enable point redemption for gift cards, with admin-managed processing.
- **Leaderboard**: Showcase top users to foster competition.
- **Admin Tools**: Provide commands for point drops and panel management.

## Connectivity
The bot connects to Discord using the `discord.js` library and a bot token. Two connection methods are provided:
1. **Hardcoded Token**: A token is included directly in the code (`client.login('MTM4NjM2...')`). **Note**: This is insecure and not recommended for production.
2. **Environment Variable**: Uses `process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN` for secure token management via a `.env` file or server environment (recommended).

### Setup Instructions
1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure Node.js (v16 or higher) is installed.
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install discord.js
   ```
3. **Configure Token**:
   - Create a `.env` file with:
     ```env
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
     ```
   - Alternatively, replace the hardcoded token in `index.js` (not recommended).
4. **Set Channel IDs**: Update the `CHANNELS` object in `index.js` with your Discord server's channel IDs.
5. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
6. **Invite Bot to Server**: Create a bot application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), generate an invite link with appropriate permissions, and add it to your server.

### Data Persistence
- User data (points, streaks, inventory, etc.) is saved to `bot_data.json` on every interaction and every 5 minutes via an auto-save interval.
- If `bot_data.json` doesn't exist, the bot starts with an empty dataset and creates the file on the first save.

## Commands
The bot supports the following slash commands, each restricted to specific channels defined in the `CHANNELS` object:

### User Commands

## Gift Card System
- **Available Gift Card**: PCRP Gift Card (500 üíé).
- **Process**:
  1. Use `/redeem_gift_card` or `/convert_points` to select a gift card.
  2. Points are deducted, and a request is created.
  3. Admins process the request, and the gift card code is sent via DM.
- **Pending Feature**: Converting gift cards back to points (`/convert_giftcard`).

## Startup Behavior
On startup, the bot:
1. Loads data from `bot_data.json`.
2. Registers slash commands globally.
3. Clears old bot messages in configured channels.
4. Sends panels to the following channels:
   - **Daily Claims**: Embed with a claim button.
   - **Gambling**: Embed with game buttons.
   - **Gift Cards**: Embed with gift card options and buttons.
   - **Leaderboard**: Embed with top 10 users.

## Error Handling
- Commands check for correct channel usage and provide feedback if used in the wrong channel.
- Gambling games validate bets and user balances.
- DM tests ensure users have DMs enabled.
- Data loading handles missing files gracefully, starting fresh if needed.

## Security Notes
- **Token Security**: Avoid hardcoding the bot token in production. Use environment variables (e.g., `.env` file) to prevent accidental exposure.
- **Permissions**: Admin commands (`/drop_points`, `/send_daily_claim`, `/send_gift_card_panel`) require Administrator permissions.
- **DMs**: Users must enable DMs from server members for gift card delivery.

## Troubleshooting
- **Bot Not Responding**: Check the token, ensure the bot is invited to the server, and verify channel IDs in `CHANNELS`.
- **Data Not Saving**: Ensure write permissions for `bot_data.json`.
- **Command Errors**: Verify channel IDs and user permissions. Check console logs for errors.

## Future Improvements
- Implement point drop system (`/drop_points`).
- Complete gift card conversion back to points (`/convert_giftcard`).
- Add more gift card options.
- Enhance gambling games with additional features or animations.
- Implement rate limiting for commands to prevent abuse.
